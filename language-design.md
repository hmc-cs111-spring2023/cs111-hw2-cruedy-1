**Question**

Pick three quotes from the readings about language design. Good candidates
are:

- Something you agreed with / resonates with your own experience
- Something you disagree with
- Something that is interesting, a new idea or perspective you'd like to remember
- Something you didn't understand

For each quote, describe what it was about the quote that led you pick it.

**Response**

### Quote 1:
_"Should a programming language be small or large? A small programming language might take but a short time to learn. A large programming language may take a long, long time to learn, but then it is less hard to use, for we then have a lot of words at hand—or, I should say, at the tips of our tongues—to use at the drop of a hat."(Steele)_

_I dont completely agree with this quote because sometimes a small, simple language could be easier to use if you understand how to redefine more things to add to that language. Sometimes the larger the language, the more complicated it gets, so it gets hard to figure out what patterns to use for the larger language._

### Quote 2:
_"Stefik says. 'The problem is that programming languages are created either by committee or by extreme technical wizards with magical math powers. The broad computer science academic community has not paid a tremendous amount of attention to programming language usability. I think that our discipline mostly uses anecdotes to argue about programming languages. As such, it is no wonder that the arguments get heated.'"(Pavlus)_

_I think there are many languages that are usable or at least logically simple to understand like Python and Java. There also many programs that make programming languages simple, like Scratch. I also dont believe that that programming language usability hasn't been focused on by the computer science community because most languages that aren't very usable or readable have been eradicated._

### Quote 3:

_"You can't please everyone so aim to displease everyone equally. Most APIs are overconstrained."(Bloch)_

_I don't really undestand how APIs are usually overconstrained. I know they normally have a specfic purpose and can't do much more that extend one software._

**Question**

How would you know a well-designed language? What are the symptoms? How would you know a poorly designed language? What are the symptoms?

**Response**
_Some priorities of a well-designed programming language are usability and readability. For me, most well-designed programming languages are based off of a successful spoken language, so that new users of the pl who use that spoken language can easily learn and use the pl._

_Poorly designed languages tend to use a lot of new patterns and symbols that aren't used in already established languages. This would make the language difficult to read or learn because the alphabet is completely different from a user's origin language. This could also make it difficult to write because it might need its own keyboard._

**Question**

How might the themes of _Growing a Language_ relate to notions of fluency from last week's class?

**Response**

_ _Growing a Language_ discusses what to prioritize when creating a programmign language. I takes about the problems with languages that are too long or too short. In class we talked about how languages need to follow a pattern to be easy to understand, and this paper talks about having a pattern in a language to make it easy to learn and not too complicated. _

**Question**

In what way is an API a language?

**Response**

_APIs have a specfic structure, just like a language. They also need to be usable and readable in order to gain traction. Good APIs can grow quickly and change how software is used._

**Question**

What does the post on grayscale tell us about the process of API design?

_The grayscale post shows that a lot of functions designed in APIs can do similar things but in differnet ways. The gray(), white(), and black() functions seem to all be able to perform the same tasks, but with different parameters. There are also shorthand ways to do the same operation, like with rgba() in the grayscale post._

**Question**

The Pavlus article mentions the researchers' comments that people preferred
"natural-language replacements for some of the more abstruse syntax". In other
words, people found it easier to work with code that looks more like a human language (e.g.,
English). Consider the following quote by William R. Cook, one of the creators
of AppleScript:

> The experiment in designing a language that resembled natural languages (English
> and Japanese) was not successful. It was assumed that scripts should be
> presented in “natural language” so that average people could read and write
> them. … In the end the syntactic variations and flexibility did more to confuse
> programmers than to help them out. It is not clear whether it is easier for
> novice users to work with a scripting language that resembles natural language,
> with all its special cases and idiosyncrasies. The main problem is that
> AppleScript only appears to be a natural language: in fact, it is an artificial
> language, like any other programming language. … even small changes to the
> script may introduce subtle syntactic errors that baffle users. It is easy to
> read AppleScript, but quite hard to write it.
> [[Cook 2007, page 1-20]](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=1238844.1238845)

Are these two experiences of natural languages at odds with one another? Would
you choose to include natural language in the design of a DSL? If so, how might
you do so? If not, why not?

**Response**

_Not really because the second experience is just more specific. I think programming languages that follow natural languages are still better for learning, but it can't follow all the grammar and syntax of a natural language because PLs aren't really meant to be spoken languages. I think the logical of a PL needs to be the same as that of a natural language, but the structure should defintely be different._
